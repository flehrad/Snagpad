# Snagpad
QMK for Snagpad

This PCB can be used as a standard numpad, or a ortho 5x4 macropad.

Gerber for production of the PCB and .json

Two .json files to support the two layout options, combination layout you will need to creat it yourself.

The Gerber PCB Zip files internally are labelled FHANv3, this is due to it being cloned from my FHAN design. View the gerber zip in a gerber viewer to confirm and give yourself confidence it is the Snagpad if required.

Build requires a pro micro.

Can be built as single PCB with custom case, or as two PCB style with standoffs.
